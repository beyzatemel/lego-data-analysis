# lego-data-analysis
## The Goal of This Analysis
This analysis aims to help a company decide which LEGOÂ® sets to sell by examining a dataset with details such as target age ranges, reviews, piece counts, themes, and difficulty levels. By identifying popular and profitable products, the company can make data-driven decisions to optimize its selection. For this analysis, price information is not used, as the focus is on selecting the best sets, not determining their pricing. First choosing which products, pricing second is more reasonable and effective.



## About Dataset 
* Link to the lego dataset used in this project : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mterzolo/lego-sets
  
The dataset includes key attributes such as:  
* ages : The recommended age range for the LEGO set.  
* list_price : The price of the LEGO set in the corresponding country.  
* num_reviews	: The number of customer reviews the LEGO set has received. 
* piece_count : The total number of LEGO pieces included in the set.  
* play_star_rating : Average rating (out of 5 stars) given by customers for playability or fun factor.  (5 being the best)
* prod_desc : A short description of the LEGO set.    	
* prod_id	: A unique identifier number for the LEGO set.  
* prod_long_desc :  A detailed description of the LEGO set, often including features and additional details. 
* review_difficulty : Indicates how challenging the LEGO set is to build.  
* set_name : The name of the LEGO set.   	
* star_rating : Overall average rating (out of 5 stars) based on customer reviews.  	
* theme_name : The theme or category of the LEGO set. (e.g., "Star Wars," "Harry Potter," "City.").
